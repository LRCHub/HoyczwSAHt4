[00:07.57] I couldn't wait for you to come clear the cupboards
[00:15.37] But now you're going to leave with nothing but a sign
[00:23.18] Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines
[00:31.13] Because I missed you all the time
[00:47.63] 
[00:36.93] So, get away
[00:39.28] Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
[00:43.66] And let yourself go
[00:46.72] You know you didn't lose your self-control
[00:50.67] Let's start at the rainbow
[01:03.67] 
[00:53.22] Turn away
[00:54.76] Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
[00:58.80] Let yourself go
[01:01.97] Is that a compromise?
[01:12.47] 
[01:07.03] So what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
[01:11.56] There's a party soon, do you wanna go?
[01:13.96] A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
[01:18.91] I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
[01:36.41] 
[01:22.59] 'Cause I rеally wanna stay at your house
[01:26.43] And I hope this works out
[01:30.02] But you know how much you broke me apart
[01:32.87] I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
[01:36.22] I don't wanna know
[01:45.22] 
[01:47.43] And I'm awarе that you were lying in the gutter
[01:54.74] 'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide
[02:02.63] So when you tell me I'm the reason I just can't believe the lies
[02:10.99] And why do I so want to call you? (Call you, call you, call you)
[02:42.99] 
[02:16.20] So what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
[02:20.09] There's a party soon, do you wanna go?
[02:23.26] A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
[02:27.76] I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
[02:45.26] 
[02:31.44] 'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
[02:35.24] And I hope this works out
[02:39.24] But you know how much you broke me apart
[02:41.82] I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
[02:45.17] I don't wanna know
[02:54.17] 
[02:48.28] You
[02:53.90] Oh-oh-oh-oh
[02:57.54] I don't know why I'm no one
[03:11.04] 
[03:02.30] So, get away
[03:05.57] Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
[03:09.36] And let yourself go
[03:12.27] You know you didn't lose your self-control
[03:16.57] Let's start at the rainbow
[03:29.57] 
[03:19.53] Turn away
[03:20.60] Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
[03:25.03] Let yourself go
[03:27.60] Is that a compromise?
[03:38.10] 
[03:36.82] So what do you wanna do? What's your point of view?
[03:40.73] There's a party soon, do you wanna go?
[03:44.24] A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
[03:48.44] I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
[04:05.94] 
[03:52.01] 'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
[03:56.16] And I hope this works out
[03:59.58] But you know how much you broke me apart
[04:01.86] I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
[04:06.79] I don't wanna know
